Like its neighbouring park, the hotel is a picture of oppositional harmony, where the manic and the peaceful, the new and the traditional meet. Inside the hotel are a number of different accommodation options, including traditional Japanese rooms, more Western-style offerings and, for those looking for something a little different, even Hello Kitty themed rooms.",
